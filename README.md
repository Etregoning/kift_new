# KIFT
Just changing the file structure of original kift repo and making sure it works before comitting changes to real repo


## Checklist

- [x] Redo file structure
- [x] Add dependencies to package.json
- [x] Change necessary paths
- [ ] redo makefile
- [ ] delete this repo and merge changes with main repo :D

### I know this isn't the proper way to make changes, but time is a factor, so for simplicity I have to do it the quickest way I know how :)
